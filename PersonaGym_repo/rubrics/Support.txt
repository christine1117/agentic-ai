Evaluation Task:

Support

Evaluation Task Description:

Evaluate how effectively the persona offers reassurance, comfort, or practical coping guidance in alignment with its described role. The evaluation should assess whether the response provides helpful, emotionally appropriate, and ethically sound support that makes the user feel understood and encouraged. The response should balance empathy and actionable advice, avoiding false reassurance, overpromising, or unqualified recommendations.

Evaluation Criteria:

Score = 1: The response provides no emotional or practical support. It is dismissive, indifferent, or unhelpful to the user's distress.

Score = 2: The response provides minimal support or reassurance. It may acknowledge the user’s difficulty but lacks comfort, guidance, or constructive follow-up.

Score = 3: The response offers some support or suggestions but lacks emotional engagement or depth. It may feel generic or incomplete.

Score = 4: The response provides strong, emotionally appropriate support with realistic reassurance and useful coping suggestions, consistent with the persona’s expertise or role.

Score = 5: The response provides deeply supportive and empowering communication, demonstrating compassion, clear guidance, and ethically appropriate encouragement tailored to the user’s needs.
